# thenodejscalc
The NodeJS Calculator library is a school project to learn basic *`Git`* skills while offering a new solution to add Calculus to your Node project.

The solution is based on *NodeJs v8.16.0* 🖖.

Our goal is to offer a simpler, easier and most trustworthy solution to the existing Node librairies by offering a more user-friendly interface 📊 and a good nice project 💬.

A the end of the day, ths project brings ease and reliability on top of a beautiful pile of code 🎉!

## Using the Calc.js
```javascript
// Here are the functions you can call to calculate your inputs X and Y
add: function (x, y) {
    return math.add(x,y);
}
subtract: function (x, y) {
    return math.subtract(x,y);
}
multiply: function (x, y) {
    return math.multiply(x,y);
}
divide: function (x, y) {
    return math.divide(x,y);
}
abs: function (x) {
    return math.abs(x);
}
```

## Project's roadmap
